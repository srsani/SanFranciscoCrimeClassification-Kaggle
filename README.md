# Kaggle-SanFranciscoCrimeClassification
Kaggle hosted this competition as a fun practice, with dataset provided by [SF OpenData]( https://data.sfgov.org).

This project is focusing on making a tool to improve the safety of San Francisco city. This task can be achieved by producing a predictive model that enables police department resources to be spent more effectively and efficiently, which will result in reduced number of crimes.

In this repository, initially the original data set was visualized. Following that, through feature extraction three datasets was created and the performance of some of the most suitable machine learning algorithms was tested.

To run the codes in this repository you need to download the original data set either form [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime) or [here]( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5666137/sf/Test%26trainDataSet.zip) and palace the two .cvs files in “Dataset” folder.
